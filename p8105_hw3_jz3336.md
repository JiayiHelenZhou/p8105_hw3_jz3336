## Problem 1

``` r
data("instacart")
```

This dataset contain 1384617 rows and 15 columns.

Observations are the level of items in orders by users. There are user /
order variables: user ID, order ID, order hours of the day, and so on.
There are also item variables: product id, product name, aisle,
department.

1.  How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items
    ordered from?

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
```

    ## # A tibble: 134 x 2
    ##    aisle                              n
    ##    <chr>                          <int>
    ##  1 fresh vegetables              150609
    ##  2 fresh fruits                  150473
    ##  3 packaged vegetables fruits     78493
    ##  4 yogurt                         55240
    ##  5 packaged cheese                41699
    ##  6 water seltzer sparkling water  36617
    ##  7 milk                           32644
    ##  8 chips pretzels                 31269
    ##  9 soy lactosefree                26240
    ## 10 bread                          23635
    ## # … with 124 more rows

2.  Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle,
    limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange
    aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  count(aisle) %>% 
  filter(n > 10000) %>% 
  mutate( 
    aisle = factor(aisle),
    aisle = fct_reorder(aisle, n)
    ) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 270,  vjust = 0.5,  hjust = 1))
```

3.  Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the
    aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged
    vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered
    in your table.

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  count(product_name) %>% 
  mutate(rank = min_rank(desc(n))) %>% 
  filter(rank < 4) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, rank) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

| aisle                      | product\_name                                 |    n | rank |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------- | ---: | ---: |
| baking ingredients         | Light Brown Sugar                             |  499 |    1 |
| baking ingredients         | Pure Baking Soda                              |  387 |    2 |
| baking ingredients         | Cane Sugar                                    |  336 |    3 |
| dog food care              | Snack Sticks Chicken & Rice Recipe Dog Treats |   30 |    1 |
| dog food care              | Organix Chicken & Brown Rice Recipe           |   28 |    2 |
| dog food care              | Small Dog Biscuits                            |   26 |    3 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Baby Spinach                          | 9784 |    1 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Raspberries                           | 5546 |    2 |
| packaged vegetables fruits | Organic Blueberries                           | 4966 |    3 |

4.  Make a table showing the mean hour of the day at which Pink Lady
    Apples and Coffee Ice Cream are ordered on each day of the week;
    format this table for human readers (i.e. produce a 2 x 7 table).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(product_name %in% c("Pink Lady Apples", "Coffee Ice Cream")) %>% 
  group_by(product_name, order_dow) %>% 
  summarize(mean_hour = mean(order_hour_of_day)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(
    names_from = order_dow,
    values_from = mean_hour
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` regrouping output by 'product_name' (override with `.groups` argument)

    ## # A tibble: 2 x 8
    ## # Groups:   product_name [2]
    ##   product_name       `0`   `1`   `2`   `3`   `4`   `5`   `6`
    ##   <chr>            <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
    ## 1 Coffee Ice Cream  13.8  14.3  15.4  15.3  15.2  12.3  13.8
    ## 2 Pink Lady Apples  13.4  11.4  11.7  14.2  11.6  12.8  11.9

## Problem 2

1.  Load, tidy, and otherwise wrangle the data. Your final dataset
    should include all originally observed variables and values; have
    useful variable names; include a weekday vs weekend variable; and
    encode data with reasonable variable classes. Describe the resulting
    dataset (e.g. what variables exist, how many observations, etc).

<!-- end list -->

``` r
accelerometer_df = 
  read_csv("./hw3_data/accel_data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    activity_1:activity_1440, 
    names_to = "minute_of_the_day",
    names_prefix = "activity_", 
    values_to = "activity_count"
  ) %>% 
  mutate(
    weekday_vs_weekend = 
      recode(day,
    Sunday = "weekend",
    Saturday = "weekend",
    Friday = "weekday",
    Thursday = "weekday",
    Wednesday = "weekday",
    Tuesday = "weekday",
    Monday = "weekday"),
    weekday_vs_weekend = factor(weekday_vs_weekend)) %>% 
  relocate(weekday_vs_weekend, .after = day)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_double(),
    ##   day = col_character()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

The resulting dataset has 50400 rows and 6 columns. There are 6
variables, where the “week” “day\_id” "“day” variables are retained from
the original dataset. Every 1440 observations is a day, and there are 35
days in total record by the dataset. The new factor variable
“weekday\_vs\_weekend” separate the observations into two categories:
weekday and weekend. The “minute\_of\_the\_day” and “activity\_count”
variables store the collected information of the original
activity1-1440. For each day, “minute\_of\_the\_day” will count from the
1st minute to the last 1440th minute then repeat from 1 as the next day
start. At the same time, activity\_count record the activity count of
each corresponding minute.
